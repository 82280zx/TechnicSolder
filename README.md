# Installation
**1. Install Ubuntu Server 18.04 (https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server)** \n
**2. Login to Ubuntu with credentials you set.** \n
**3. Become root**
```bash
$ sudo passwd root
```
Write you current password, then set new root password
```bash
$ exit
```
Login as root \n
**4. Install LAMP pack**
Note: apt will tell you which packages it plans to install and how much extra disk space they'll take up. Press Y and hit Enter to continue, and the installation will proceed.
```bash
$ apt update
$ apt install apache2
$ apt install mysql-server
$ mysql_secure_installation
```
You will be asked if you want to configure the VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN. Answer **y**
Then you'll be asked to select a level of password validation. Answer **0** and set your mysql password.
You'll be asked for a few more thing, answer **y** to all.
```bash
$ apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
$ nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
```
We want to move the PHP index file to the first position after the DirectoryIndex specification: \n
DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm -> DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm
Configuration will look like this:
```bash
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm
</IfModule>
```
When you are finished, save and close the file by pressing Ctrl-X. You'll have to confirm the save by typing Y and then hit Enter to confirm the file save location.
```bash
$ service apache2 restart
$ nano /var/www/html/index.php.php
```
This will open a blank file. We want to put the following text, which is valid PHP code, inside the file:
```bash
<?php
phpinfo();
```
When you are finished, save and close the file.
Now we can test whether our web server can correctly display content generated by a PHP script. To try this out, we just have to visit this page in our web browser. You'll need your server's public IP address.
```bash
curl http://icanhazip.com
```
Open in your web browser: http://your_server_IP_address
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TheGameSpider/TechnicSolder.git
```
